# Murder Mystery - Minigame

Just started working on this project today. There's a bunch to be done
but I do have hopes I will finish it and learn a bunch. In this project
I have a lot of stuff that I'm aiming to do, which I honestly have no idea
how to do, that's why I'm excited to try it out, as I'll be able to learn new things.

## Plans
-> Actually do it lol...
-> Add support for MongoDB
-> Complete the api.
